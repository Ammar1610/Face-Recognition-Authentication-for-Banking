Authentication plays a pivotal role in securing access to online systems, especially in the context of banking, where protecting sensitive financial data is crucial. Traditional authentication mechanisms, such as passwords and personal identification numbers (PINs), have long been used as the primary means of verifying user identity. However, these methods are increasingly vulnerable to various attacks, including phishing, brute force, and social engineering. The rise in cyber threats has necessitated the development of more robust and user-friendly authentication mechanisms.
Biometric authentication has emerged as a viable alternative to traditional methods, offering enhanced security and ease of use. Biometrics rely on unique physical or behavioural traits, such as fingerprints, iris patterns, or facial features, making them difficult to replicate or steal. Among these, face recognition stands out due to its non-intrusive nature and the advancements in computer vision technology that have made it both accurate and efficient. Face recognition systems analyse and verify a person’s identity based on their facial features, ensuring secure access and seamless user experiences.
This paper introduces a Face Recognition Authentication System integrated into a banking website. The primary objective of this system is to replace traditional PIN-based transaction verification with a secure and efficient face recognition process. The website enables users to register by providing essential details and uploading documents such as passports or driving licenses for Know Your Customer (KYC) compliance. During registration, users also upload a profile picture, which serves as the reference image for subsequent face recognition-based authentication.
The banking website, developed using the Django framework along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offers a range of functionalities. Users can view their account balance, perform fund transfers, and make deposits. A dedicated dashboard provides an overview of their financial activities, enhancing user engagement and experience. The key innovation lies in the integration of the Python Face Recognition library, which is responsible for ensuring secure transaction authentication. The library employs advanced algorithms to compare the user’s live image with the stored profile picture, verifying their identity with a high degree of accuracy.
The Python Face Recognition library, built on the dlib machine learning toolkit, leverages state-of-the-art techniques such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect and encode facial features. The encoding process generates a 128-dimensional vector that uniquely represents the user’s face. During authentication, the system computes the Euclidean distance between the stored encoding and the live image’s encoding. If the distance falls within a predefined threshold, the authentication is successful.
By integrating face recognition into the banking website, this system addresses the limitations of traditional authentication methods while offering a seamless and secure user experience. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the system’s design, methodology, implementation, and potential future enhancements. The proposed solution not only enhances security but also demonstrates the potential of biometric authentication in revolutionizing the banking sector.
